C-Application, currently running in XCode

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is my master-thesis in computational physics at the chair of Prof. Hartmut Ruhl at LMU-Munich.
* In detail, plasma simulations are implemented, using FDTD algorithm and a Hybrid Field approach to propagate fields on the numerical grid. Particle pushes are perfoemed by using a Boris Pusher or alternatively an adaptive NystrÃ¶m Pusher.

### Setup ###

* Run "HybridFields.xcodeproj" and check system path in "system(...)" command
* Configuration --> none
* Dependencies --> none (yet)
* Database configuration
